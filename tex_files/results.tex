Using the datasets from University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository~\cite{uci_datasets}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cardiac arrythmia dataset~\cite{dataset_cardiac_arythmia}, dataset with 452 instances and a big number of attributes - 279, representing attributes of people having cardiac arrythmia and their organs' states,
\item Handwritten numerals dataset~\cite{dataset_handwritten_numerals}, this dataset consists of features of handwritten numerals ($0$ - $9$) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. 200 patterns per class (for a total of 2,000 patterns) with 64 attributes have been digitized in  binary images and represented in terms of few feature sets that are defined in referenced \emph{arff} file~\cite{dataset_handwritten_numerals},
\item Steel plates faults dataset~\cite{dataset_steel_plates_faults}, describing faults of steel plates like, e.g.: scratches, depth of the scratch, bumps or height of bump. This dataset totals to 1941 instances with 33 attributes each.
\end{itemize}

While using the implemented solution with aforementioned datasets, parameter $k = 30$ has been chosen to calculate the results.

\subsection{Cardiac arrythmia dataset}
\label{subsec:cardiac}
In cardiac arrythmia dataset one can observe assortativity coefficient stabilizing at around $0.31$ indicating assortative mixing.
Between $k$ 1 and 2 we can observe change in assortativity from disassortative to assortative.

Skewness of in-degrees is oscilating around level of $1.4 - 1.5$.
Its level indicates hubs phenomena present in this dataset.

\subsection{Handwritten numerals dataset}
Handwritten numerals dataset exhibits lower level of stable assortativity index level, at around $0.27$.
In this dataset we can see smaller gap between Pearson correlation coefficient and both skewness and coefficient of variation.

Similarily to cardiac arrythmia dataset in Section~\ref{subsec:cardiac} we can observe a change of assortativity between $k$ 1 and 2 from disassortative to assortative.

Positive skewness of in-degrees proves presence of hubs in kNN graph to be built upon this dataset.

\subsection{Steel plate faults dataset}
Steel plate faults dataset exhibits quite different parameters than 2 previous ones.
Its assortativity index stabilizes at around $0.31$ as in previous examples yet covariance of variation of nodes in-degrees descends below level of $0.3$ overlapping with assortativity index.

Skewness of nodes' in-degrees descends to negative values up until $-1.2$ for $k = 30$ indicating abence of hubness phenomena.

\subsection{General conclusions}
General conclusion taken from aforementioned 3 datasets are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item k-NN graphs tend to be dissasortative or show no (dis)assortative mixing for small k ($k = 1$),
\item k-NN graphs tend to be assortative for large $k$,
\item assortativity for large $k$s occurs regardless of hubness phenomena ( e.g. both cardiac arrythmia dataset steel plates faults dataset positively assortative with and without hubs respectively) 
\end{itemize}
